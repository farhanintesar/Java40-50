🧮 Java Array Tasks (40–50)

A collection of Java array exercises focusing on fundamental operations like searching, sorting, reversing, and matrix manipulation.
Each task demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and array handling techniques.

🧠 Task 40 — Sum & Average of Array Elements

Calculate the sum and average of all elements in an array.

// Example: [2, 4, 6] → Sum = 12, Average = 4.0

🔢 Task 41 — Number of Occurrences

Find how many times a specific element occurs in an array.

// Example: [1, 2, 2, 3], target = 2 → Occurrences = 2

📊 Task 42 — Minimum & Maximum in Array

Determine the smallest and largest values in an array.

// Example: [5, 8, 2, 9] → Min = 2, Max = 9

📈 Task 43 — Check if Array is Sorted

Check whether an array is sorted in ascending order.

// Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Sorted ✅

🗑️ Task 44 — Delete a Specific Element

Return a new array after deleting a specific element.

// Example: [1, 2, 3, 2], delete = 2 → New Array = [1, 3]

🔄 Task 45 — Reverse an Array

Reverse the order of elements in an array.

// Example: [1, 2, 3] → [3, 2, 1]

🪞 Task 46 — Check if Array is Palindrome

Check whether an array reads the same forward and backward.

// Example: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] → Palindrome ✅

🔗 Task 47 — Merge Two Sorted Arrays

Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

// Example: [1, 3, 5] + [2, 4, 6] → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

🧩 Task 48 — Search in 2D Array

Search for a specific element inside a 2D array (matrix).

// Example: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] → search 5 → Found ✅

🔍 Task 49 — Search & Average in 2D Array

Search for an element and calculate the average of all elements in a 2D array.

// Example: [[2,4],[6,8]] → Average = 5.0

🔺 Task 50 — Sum of Diagonals in 2D Array

Find the sum of both diagonals in a square matrix.

// Example: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] → Diagonal Sum = 1+5+9 + 3+5+7 = 30
